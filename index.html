  <h2>What gets me excited about a project is the story behind it.</h2>
  
   <p> Previously, I worked in media production as a project manager. A major part of my day was understanding the vision of the writers and producers in order to create an environment where their stories can be realized. Creating that environment required not just mastery of the creative tools, but also interpreting communication styles and organizing my teams accordingly.</p> 
   <p>My goal is to land a position with a creative, and innovative company that will enable me to enhance my design and product management expertise.</p>
